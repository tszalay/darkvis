Dark matter visualization software, summer research 2008

See the [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2055) or the description on [my website](http://tamas-szalay.squarespace.com/dark-matter).

I'm not sure whether the code still runs or where the data for it is, so it's really just preserved here for posterity.
